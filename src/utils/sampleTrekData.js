  description: `
    <p>The Bhrigu Lake Trek is one of the most picturesque and accessible high-altitude alpine lake treks in Himachal Pradesh. Named after the sage Bhrigu, this pristine lake sits at an elevation of 14,100 feet in the upper Kullu Valley.</p>
    
    <p>What makes this trek special is that it offers stunning views of snow-capped mountains, lush meadows, and dense forests in a relatively short duration, making it perfect for beginners and experienced trekkers alike. The trek starts from Gulaba, just 10 km from Manali, and takes you through beautiful oak and cedar forests before opening up to vast alpine meadows known locally as "thachi."</p>
    
    <p>The lake itself is believed to have religious significance as Maharishi Bhrigu is said to have meditated beside these waters. Depending on the season, you might find the lake in different avatars - from a frozen ice disc in early summer to a pristine blue lake surrounded by wildflowers in late summer.</p>

The lake itself was partially frozen and absolutely magical. Our guide Tenzing was extremely knowledgeable and made sure everyone was comfortable despite the altitude. Highly recommend!"

      content: "Great trek for beginners! The views are spectacular and worth every bit of effort. The lake was completely frozen when we visited in early June which was a unique experience. The camping arrangements were comfortable and the food was surprisingly good considering we were in the mountains. Only suggestion would be to provide better information about dealing with AMS beforehand."
