# Email Function Fix - Nodemailer Method Name

## 🐛 Issue Found
The Firebase Cloud Function was throwing a 500 error with the message:
```
"nodemailer.createTransporter is not a function"
```

## ✅ Root Cause
**Incorrect method name**: The function was calling `nodemailer.createTransporter()` instead of the correct `nodemailer.createTransport()`.

## 🔧 Fix Applied
Changed the method call in `functions/index.js`:

**Before (incorrect):**
```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: emailUser,
    pass: emailPassword
  }
});
```

**After (correct):**
```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: emailUser,
    pass: emailPassword
  }
});
```

## 📋 Status
- ✅ **Fix deployed successfully** to Firebase Cloud Functions
- ✅ **All functions updated** and operational
- ✅ **Email functionality should now work** correctly

## 🧪 Testing
The email function should now work properly when you:
1. Make a test booking
2. Complete the payment process
3. Check that the confirmation email is sent successfully

The detailed logging we added earlier will help confirm that the email is being sent without errors.

## 📚 Reference
The correct nodemailer documentation shows the method as `createTransport`:
